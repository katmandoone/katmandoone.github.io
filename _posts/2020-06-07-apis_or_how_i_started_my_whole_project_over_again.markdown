So, for my first real Data Science project, I was tasked with analyzing movie data and using that analysis to make recommendations for a new movie studio. The project invited me to use APIs and web-scraping if I so desired, but it also provided several .csv and .tsv files to pull data from. Naturally, I ignored the invitation and got right to work on making pandas DataFrames out of those .csv files and just merging away. I did a decent job with it, I think, and I ended up with several plots for my project. I should have moved on to the presentation and been done with it. But then came a little voice in the back of mind, "Do you feel good about this data?"

And I didn't feel particularly good about the data. It wasn't mine. I just found it, and I couldn't really be sure of what it contained, because I was not the one who set the parameters for the data being gathered. So I went to tmdb.org and signed up for my very own API key and set of on my very own data-gathering journey.
