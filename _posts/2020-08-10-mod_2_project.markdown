This is the placeholder for my blog post. I'll be writing about some things from the Mod 2 Final Project. I might discuss one-hot encoding. Maybe I'll talk about multicollinearity. Maybe I'll talk about methods for removing outliers from the data. I don't know yet. I'll come up with something, though.
