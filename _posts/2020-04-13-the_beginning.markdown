I've had many interests in my life. When I started my first year in college, I was a bit overwhelmed by all the possibilities. I changed majors about every semester: Computer Science, English, then Philosophy. I eventually settled on Music Composition, though it was more of a misunderstanding than an actual decision. I finished it out, though, and I really enjoyed the study and my fellow music students.

After college, I found a job in a factory making headlamps and taillamps for cars. It wasn't my ideal job, but it paid  well enough, and the income allowed my girlfriend to take the classes she needed to be a certified Activities Director. Time passed, as it always seems to do, and five years later I'm married with a mortgage and expecting a child. It's time to move away from the factory, I think, but the income and health insurance are too important for a clean break.

So I've come back to my original interest: Computer Science. With the Flatiron School's online Data Science program, I'm really hoping to be able to learn the skills I need to break into a new career path, both for the sake of my growing family and my own mental welfare. I'm ready for an intellectual challenge, and I'm ready for a more mentally stimulating career.

Data Science seemed like a good choice because I've always enjoyed math and I'm fascinated by the concept of machine learning. It seems like an exciting field of study, and I'm ready to learn all about it. I know the next several months are going to be tough and there's going to be a lot of information to take in, but I'm eager to take on the challenge and learn new skills.

I'm excited to build a better future for myself.
